## CVE-2025-61781

**CVSS Score:** 7.1 | **Status:** Recently Updated | **Vendors:** citeum

OpenCTI is an open source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.8.1, the GraphQL mutation "WorkspacePopoverDeletionMutation" allows users to delete workspace-related objects such as dashboards and investigation cases. However, the mutation lacks proper authorization checks to verify ownership of the targeted resources.
An attacker can exploit this by supplying an active UUID of another user. Since the API does not validate whether the requester owns the resource, the mutation executes successfully, resulting in unauthorized deletion of the entire workspace. Version 6.8.1 fixes the issue.

## CVE-2025-65110

**CVSS Score:** 8.1 | **Status:** Recently Updated | **Vendors:** vega_project

Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to versions 6.1.2 and 5.6.3, applications meeting two conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. First, they use `vega` in an application that attaches both `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window`, or has any other satisfactory function gadgets in the global scope. Second, they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). This vulnerability allows for DOM XSS, potentially stored, potentially reflected, depending on how the library is being used. The vulnerability requires user interaction with the page to trigger. An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking a user into opening a malicious Vega specification. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application’s domain. This can lead to theft of sensitive information such as authentication tokens, manipulation of data displayed to the user, or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim. This exploit compromises confidentiality and integrity of impacted applications.Patched versions are available in `vega-selections@6.1.2` (requires ESM) for Vega v6 and `vega-selections@5.6.3` (no ESM needed) for Vega v5. As a workaround, do not attach `vega` or `vega.View` instances to global variables or the window as the editor used to do. This is a development-only debugging practice that should not be used in any situation where Vega/Vega-lite definitions can come from untrusted parties.

## CVE-2026-25126

**CVSS Score:** 7.1 | **Status:** Newly Published

PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. Prior to version 0-PRERELEASE-15, the vote API route (`POST /api/v1/forum/vote`) trusts the JSON body’s `direction` value without runtime validation. TypeScript types are not enforced at runtime, so an attacker can send arbitrary strings (e.g., `"x"`) as `direction`. Downstream (`VoteServer`) treats any non-`"up"` and non-`null` value as a downvote and persists the invalid value in `votes_data`. This can be exploited to bypass intended business logic. Version 0-PRERELEASE-15 fixes the vulnerability.

## CVE-2026-24902

**CVSS Score:** 7.1 | **Status:** Newly Published

TrustTunnel is an open-source VPN protocol with a server-side request forgery and and private network restriction bypass in versions prior to 0.9.114. In `tcp_forwarder.rs`, SSRF protection for `allow_private_network_connections = false` was only applied in the `TcpDestination::HostName(peer)` path. The `TcpDestination::Address(peer) => peer` path proceeded to `TcpStream::connect()` without equivalent checks (for example `is_global_ip`, `is_loopback`), allowing loopback/private targets to be reached by supplying a numeric IP. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.114.

## CVE-2026-22806

**CVSS Score:** 9.1 | **Status:** Newly Published | **Vendors:** kubernetes

vCluster Platform provides a Kubernetes platform for managing virtual clusters, multi-tenancy, and cluster sharing. Prior to versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10, when an access key is created with a limited scope, the scope can be bypassed to access resources outside of it. However, the user still cannot access resources beyond what is accessible to the owner of the access key. Versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10 fix the vulnerability. Some other mitigations are available. Users can limit exposure by reviewing access keys which are scoped and ensuring any users with access to them have appropriate permissions set. Creating automation users with very limited permissions and using access keys for these automation users can be used as a temporary workaround where upgrading is not immediately possible but scoped access keys are needed.

## CVE-2025-56005

**CVSS Score:** 9.8 | **Status:** Recently Updated

An undocumented and unsafe feature in the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library 3.11 allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the `picklefile` parameter in the `yacc()` function. This parameter accepts a `.pkl` file that is deserialized with `pickle.load()` without validation. Because `pickle` allows execution of embedded code via `__reduce__()`, an attacker can achieve code execution by passing a malicious pickle file. The parameter is not mentioned in official documentation or the GitHub repository, yet it is active in the PyPI version. This introduces a stealthy backdoor and persistence risk.

## CVE-2026-24038

**CVSS Score:** 8.1 | **Status:** Recently Updated | **Vendors:** horilla

Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). In version 1.4.0, the OTP handling logic has a flawed equality check that can be bypassed. When an OTP expires, the server returns None, and if an attacker omits the otp field from their POST request, the user-supplied OTP is also None, causing the comparison user_otp == otp to pass. This allows an attacker to bypass two-factor authentication entirely without ever providing a valid OTP. If administrative accounts are targeted, it could lead to compromise of sensitive HR data, manipulation of employee records, and further system-wide abuse. This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0.

## CVE-2025-15467

**CVSS Score:** 9.8 | **Status:** Recently Updated

Issue summary: Parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData message with maliciously
crafted AEAD parameters can trigger a stack buffer overflow.

Impact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial
of Service, or potentially remote code execution.

When parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as
AES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is
copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits
the destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an
oversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any
authentication or tag verification occurs.

Applications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using
AEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME AuthEnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable.
Because the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material
is required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution
depends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write
primitive represents a severe risk.

The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this
issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
boundary.

OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.

## CVE-2025-68670

**CVSS Score:** 9.1 | **Status:** Recently Updated

xrdp is an open source RDP server. xrdp before v0.10.5 contains an unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The issue stems from improper bounds checking when processing user domain information during the connection sequence. If exploited, the vulnerability could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system. The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the stack buffer and the return address, which could theoretically be used to redirect the execution flow. The impact of this vulnerability is lessened if a compiler flag has been used to build the xrdp executable with stack canary protection. If this is the case, a second vulnerability would need to be used to leak the stack canary value. Upgrade to version 0.10.5 to receive a patch. Additionally, do not rely on stack canary protection on production systems.

## CVE-2025-69419

**CVSS Score:** 7.4 | **Status:** Recently Updated

Issue summary: Calling PKCS12_get_friendlyname() function on a maliciously
crafted PKCS#12 file with a BMPString (UTF-16BE) friendly name containing
non-ASCII BMP code point can trigger a one byte write before the allocated
buffer.

Impact summary: The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption
which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service.

The OPENSSL_uni2utf8() function performs a two-pass conversion of a PKCS#12
BMPString (UTF-16BE) to UTF-8. In the second pass, when emitting UTF-8 bytes,
the helper function bmp_to_utf8() incorrectly forwards the remaining UTF-16
source byte count as the destination buffer capacity to UTF8_putc(). For BMP
code points above U+07FF, UTF-8 requires three bytes, but the forwarded
capacity can be just two bytes. UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative
value is added to the output length without validation, causing the
length to become negative. The subsequent trailing NUL byte is then written
at a negative offset, causing write outside of heap allocated buffer.

The vulnerability is reachable via the public PKCS12_get_friendlyname() API
when parsing attacker-controlled PKCS#12 files. While PKCS12_parse() uses a
different code path that avoids this issue, PKCS12_get_friendlyname() directly
invokes the vulnerable function. Exploitation requires an attacker to provide
a malicious PKCS#12 file to be parsed by the application and the attacker
can just trigger a one zero byte write before the allocated buffer.
For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity according to our
Security Policy.

The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,
as the PKCS#12 implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.

## CVE-2025-69420

**CVSS Score:** 7.5 | **Status:** Recently Updated

Issue summary: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the TimeStamp Response
verification code where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first
validating the type, causing an invalid or NULL pointer dereference when
processing a malformed TimeStamp Response file.

Impact summary: An application calling TS_RESP_verify_response() with a
malformed TimeStamp Response can be caused to dereference an invalid or
NULL pointer when reading, resulting in a Denial of Service.

The functions ossl_ess_get_signing_cert() and ossl_ess_get_signing_cert_v2()
access the signing cert attribute value without validating its type.
When the type is not V_ASN1_SEQUENCE, this results in accessing invalid memory
through the ASN1_TYPE union, causing a crash.

Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed
TimeStamp Response to an application that verifies timestamp responses. The
TimeStamp protocol (RFC 3161) is not widely used and the impact of the
exploit is just a Denial of Service. For these reasons the issue was
assessed as Low severity.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,
as the TimeStamp Response implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
boundary.

OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.

## CVE-2026-0648

**CVSS Score:** 7.8 | **Status:** Recently Updated

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect error-checking logic in the CreateCounter() function (in threadx/utility/rtos_compatibility_layers/OSEK/tx_osek.c) when handling the return value of osek_get_counter(). Specifically, the current code checks if cntr_id equals 0u to determine failure, but @osek_get_counter() actually returns E_OS_SYS_STACK (defined as 12U) when it fails. This mismatch causes the error branch to never execute even when the counter pool is exhausted.

As a result, when the counter pool is depleted, the code proceeds to cast the error code (12U) to a pointer (OSEK_COUNTER *), creating a wild pointer. Subsequent writes to members of this pointer lead to writes to illegal memory addresses (e.g., 0x0000000C), which can trigger immediate HardFaults or silent memory corruption.

This vulnerability poses significant risks, including potential denial-of-service attacks (via repeated calls to exhaust the counter pool) and unauthorized memory access.

## CVE-2026-22039

**CVSS Score:** 9.9 | **Status:** Recently Updated | **Vendors:** kubernetes, teams

Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Versions prior to 1.16.3 and 1.15.3 have a critical authorization boundary bypass in namespaced Kyverno Policy apiCall. The resolved `urlPath` is executed using the Kyverno admission controller ServiceAccount, with no enforcement that the request is limited to the policy’s namespace. As a result, any authenticated user with permission to create a namespaced Policy can cause Kyverno to perform Kubernetes API requests using Kyverno’s admission controller identity, targeting any API path allowed by that ServiceAccount’s RBAC. This breaks namespace isolation by enabling cross-namespace reads (for example, ConfigMaps and, where permitted, Secrets) and allows cluster-scoped or cross-namespace writes (for example, creating ClusterPolicies) by controlling the urlPath through context variable substitution. Versions 1.16.3 and 1.15.3 contain a patch for the vulnerability.

## CVE-2026-22258

**CVSS Score:** 7.5 | **Status:** Recently Updated

Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. Prior to versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14, crafted DCERPC traffic can cause Suricata to expand a buffer w/o limits, leading to memory exhaustion and the process getting killed. While reported for DCERPC over UDP, it is believed that DCERPC over TCP and SMB are also vulnerable. DCERPC/TCP in the default configuration should not be vulnerable as the default stream depth is limited to 1MiB. Versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14 contain a patch. Some workarounds are available. For DCERPC/UDP, disable the parser. For DCERPC/TCP, the `stream.reassembly.depth` setting will limit the amount of data that can be buffered. For DCERPC/SMB, the `stream.reassembly.depth` can be used as well, but is set to unlimited by default. Imposing a limit here may lead to loss of visibility in SMB.

The url parameter in the webhook configuration does not appear to validate or restrict destination IP addresses. It accepts local addresses such as 127.0.0.1 or localhost. When a rule is triggered (Either manual trigger by manually calling the trigger endpoint or by a content update or any other triggers), the backend server executes an HTTP request to the user-supplied URL. Crucially, the server logs the full HTTP response in the rule execution log (lastDump field), which is accessible via the API. Which turns a "Blind" SSRF into a "Full Read" SSRF. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.

## CVE-2026-24765

**CVSS Score:** 7.8 | **Status:** Recently Updated | **Vendors:** hp

PHPUnit is a testing framework for PHP. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 12.5.8, 11.5.50, 10.5.62, 9.6.33, and 8.5.52 involving unsafe deserialization of code coverage data in PHPT test execution. The vulnerability exists in the `cleanupForCoverage()` method, which deserializes code coverage files without validation, potentially allowing remote code execution if malicious `.coverage` files are present prior to the execution of the PHPT test. The vulnerability occurs when a `.coverage` file, which should not exist before test execution, is deserialized without the `allowed_classes` parameter restriction. An attacker with local file write access can place a malicious serialized object with a `__wakeup()` method into the file system, leading to arbitrary code execution during test runs with code coverage instrumentation enabled. This vulnerability requires local file write access to the location where PHPUnit stores or expects code coverage files for PHPT tests. This can occur through CI/CD pipeline attacks, the local development environment, and/or compromised dependencies. Rather than just silently sanitizing the input via `['allowed_classes' => false]`, the maintainer has chosen to make the anomalous state explicit by treating pre-existing `.coverage` files for PHPT tests as an error condition. Starting in versions  in versions 12.5.8, 11.5.50, 10.5.62, 9.6.33, when a `.coverage` file is detected for a PHPT test prior to execution, PHPUnit will emit a clear error message identifying the anomalous state. Organizations can reduce the effective risk of this vulnerability through proper CI/CD configuration, including ephemeral runners, code review enforcement, branch protection, artifact isolation, and access control.

## CVE-2026-24778

**CVSS Score:** 8.8 | **Status:** Recently Updated

Ghost is an open source content management system. In Ghost versions 5.43.0 through 5.12.04 and 6.0.0 through 6.14.0, an attacker was able to craft a malicious link that, when accessed by an authenticated staff user or member, would execute JavaScript with the victim's permissions, potentially leading to account takeover. Ghost Portal versions 2.29.1 through 2.51.4 and 2.52.0 through 2.57.0 were vulnerable to this issue. Ghost automatically loads the latest patch of the members Portal component via CDN. For Ghost 5.x users, upgrading to v5.121.0 or later fixes the vulnerability. v5.121.0 loads Portal v2.51.5, which contains the patch. For Ghost 6.x users, upgrading to v6.15.0 or later fixes the vulnerability. v6.15.0 loads Portal v2.57.1, which contains the patch. For Ghost installations using a customized or self-hosted version of Portal, it will be necessary to manually rebuild from or update to the latest patch version.

## CVE-2026-24779

**CVSS Score:** 7.1 | **Status:** Recently Updated

vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). Prior to version 0.14.1, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `MediaConnector` class within the vLLM project's multimodal feature set. The load_from_url and load_from_url_async methods obtain and process media from URLs provided by users, using different Python parsing libraries when restricting the target host. These two parsing libraries have different interpretations of backslashes, which allows the host name restriction to be bypassed. This allows an attacker to coerce the vLLM server into making arbitrary requests to internal network resources. This vulnerability is particularly critical in containerized environments like `llm-d`, where a compromised vLLM pod could be used to scan the internal network, interact with other pods, and potentially cause denial of service or access sensitive data. For example, an attacker could make the vLLM pod send malicious requests to an internal `llm-d` management endpoint, leading to system instability by falsely reporting metrics like the KV cache state. Version 0.14.1 contains a patch for the issue.

## CVE-2026-24783

**CVSS Score:** 7.5 | **Status:** Recently Updated

soroban-fixed-point-math is a fixed-point math library for Soroban smart contacts. In versions 1.3.0 and 1.4.0, the `mulDiv(x, y, z)` function incorrectly handled cases where both the intermediate product $x * y$ and the divisor $z$ were negative. The logic assumed that if the intermediate product was negative, the final result must also be negative, neglecting the sign of $z$. This resulted in rounding being applied in the wrong direction for cases where both $x * y$ and $z$ were negative. The functions most at risk are `fixed_div_floor` and `fixed_div_ceil`, as they often use non-constant numbers as the divisor $z$ in `mulDiv`.  This error is present in all signed `FixedPoint` and `SorobanFixedPoint` implementations, including `i64`, `i128`, and `I256`. Versions 1.3.1 and 1.4.1 contain a patch. No known workarounds for this issue are available.

## CVE-2025-55292

**CVSS Score:** 8.2 | **Status:** Recently Updated

Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. In the current Meshtastic architecture, a Node is identified by their NodeID, generated from the MAC address, rather than their public key. This aspect downgrades the security, specifically by abusing the HAM mode which doesn't use encryption. An attacker can, as such, forge a NodeInfo on behalf of a victim node advertising that the HAM mode is enabled. This, in turn, will allow the other nodes on the mesh to accept the new information and overwriting the NodeDB. The other nodes will then only be able to send direct messages to the victim by using the shared channel key instead of the PKC. Additionally, because HAM mode by design doesn't provide any confidentiality or authentication of information, the attacker could potentially also be able to change the Node details, like the full name, short code, etc. To keep the attack persistent, it is enough to regularly resend the forged NodeInfo, in particular right after the victim sends their own. A patch is available in version 2.7.6.834c3c5.

## CVE-2026-23830

**CVSS Score:** 10.0 | **Status:** Recently Updated

SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Versions prior to 0.8.26 have a sandbox escape vulnerability due to `AsyncFunction` not being isolated in `SandboxFunction`. The library attempts to sandbox code execution by replacing the global `Function` constructor with a safe, sandboxed version (`SandboxFunction`). This is handled in `utils.ts` by mapping `Function` to `sandboxFunction` within a map used for lookups. However, before version 0.8.26, the library did not include mappings for `AsyncFunction`, `GeneratorFunction`, and `AsyncGeneratorFunction`. These constructors are not global properties but can be accessed via the `.constructor` property of an instance (e.g., `(async () => {}).constructor`). In `executor.ts`, property access is handled. When code running inside the sandbox accesses `.constructor` on an async function (which the sandbox allows creating), the `executor` retrieves the property value. Since `AsyncFunction` was not in the safe-replacement map, the `executor` returns the actual native host `AsyncFunction` constructor. Constructors for functions in JavaScript (like `Function`, `AsyncFunction`) create functions that execute in the global scope. By obtaining the host `AsyncFunction` constructor, an attacker can create a new async function that executes entirely outside the sandbox context, bypassing all restrictions and gaining full access to the host environment (Remote Code Execution). Version 0.8.26 patches this vulnerability.

## CVE-2025-62514

**CVSS Score:** 8.3 | **Status:** Newly Published | **Vendors:** exchange

Parsec is a cloud-based application for cryptographically secure file sharing. In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.6.0, `libparsec_crypto`, a component of the Parsec application, does not check for weak order point of Curve25519 when compiled with its RustCrypto backend. In practice this means an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position would be able to provide weak order points to both parties in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, resulting in a high probability to for both parties to obtain the same shared key (hence leading to a successful SAS code exchange, misleading both parties into thinking no MITM has occurred) which is also known by the attacker. Note only Parsec web is impacted (as Parsec desktop uses `libparsec_crypto` with the libsodium backend). Version 3.6.0 of Parsec patches the issue.

## CVE-2026-24772

**CVSS Score:** 8.9 | **Status:** Recently Updated

OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. To enable the real time collaboration on documents, OpenProject 17.0 introduced a synchronization server. The OpenPrioject backend generates an authentication token that is currently valid for 24 hours, encrypts it with a shared secret only known to the synchronization server. The frontend hands this encrypted token and the backend URL over to the synchronization server to check user's ability to work on the document and perform intermittent saves while editing. The synchronization server does not properly validate the backend URL and sends a request with the decrypted authentication token to the endpoint that was given to the server. An attacker could use this vulnerability to decrypt a token that he intercepted by other means to gain an access token to interact with OpenProject on the victim's behalf. This vulnerability was introduced with OpenProject 17.0.0 and was fixed in 17.0.2. As a workaround, disable the collaboration feature via Settings -> Documents -> Real time collaboration -> Disable. Additionally the `hocuspocus` container should also be disabled.

## CVE-2025-14523

**CVSS Score:** 8.2 | **Status:** Recently Updated

A flaw in libsoup’s HTTP header handling allows multiple Host: headers in a request and returns the last occurrence for server-side processing. Common front proxies often honor the first Host: header, so this mismatch can cause vhost confusion where a proxy routes a request to one backend but the backend interprets it as destined for another host. This discrepancy enables request-smuggling style attacks, cache poisoning, or bypassing host-based access controls when an attacker supplies duplicate Host headers.

## CVE-2024-4447

**CVSS Score:** 9.9 | **Status:** Recently Updated

In the System → Maintenance tool, the Logged Users tab surfaces sessionId data for all users via the Direct Web Remoting API (UserSessionAjax.getSessionList.dwr) calls. While this is information that would and should be available to admins who possess "Sign In As" powers, admins who otherwise lack this privilege would still be able to utilize the session IDs to imitate other users.


While this is a very small attack vector that requires very high permissions to execute, its danger lies principally in obfuscating attribution; all Sign In As operations are attributed appropriately in the log files, and a malicious administrator could use this information to render their dealings untraceable — including those admins who have not been granted this ability — such as by using a session ID to generate an API token.

Fixed in: 24.07.12 / 23.01.20 LTS / 23.10.24v13 LTS / 24.04.24v5 LTS

This was the original found by researcher Zakaria Agharghar.




2. Later, on October 20, 2025, another researcher (Chris O’Neill) found additional affected DWR Endpoints that are vulnerable to Information Disclosure, namely and in addition to the original found of "UserSessionAjax.getSessionList.dwr - Session ID exposure":
